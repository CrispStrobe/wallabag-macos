# Wallabag QuickSave

This is a macOS app which allows you to save links directly from Safari to a
Wallabag instance. I plan to add a Share Extension in the future as well.

You can download it in the AppStore:

## Why does it cost money?

I've first submitted **Wallabag QuickSave** to the Mac AppStore on 30th of April in 2022.
Since then I've earned $214.35 from sales and tips. I also need to pay taxes (20-30%) on this money so it's more like $161.
I also need to pay €99 ($110) per year to Apple for my developer account so the app can be made available in the store.
So having the app in the store is a loss of $169.
Some of this is buffered since I have another app in the store but I still paid more to Apple than I got revenue from both apps.
So I consider the price of **Wallabag QuickSave** as a hosting fee to Apple than income for me. If there would be a way to distribute Safari extensions without paying Apples developer fee I'd make the app free instead.

## Why are there (almost) empty releases?

On most days the AppStore shows Wallabag QuickSave on the first place when searching for `Wallabag` in the Mac AppStore.
However when there haven't been any recent releases (6-8 weeks) the AppStore "optimizes" the search and will show `iPhone & iPad Apps` instead of `Mac Apps`.
This is very noticeable in Impressions and Downloads. So in order to find the app easy to find I'll update from time to time without any major features.

## Notice

I initially planned to distribute this app outside of the AppStore but it
turned out this isn't possible.
While you can distribute apps outside of the AppStore they cannot include
Safari Extensions.

After some thought I purchased a Apple Developer Account for 99€/year to
distribute the app.
I hope that some of you chime in and support me by tipping inside the app. When
the membership comes to an end I'll see how much tips got in and reconsider if
I want to continue to pay for the membership.
