# Wallamac

This is a macOS app which allows you to save links directly from Safari to a
Wallabag instance. I plan to add a Share Extension in the future as well.

You can download it in the AppStore: ![https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-download-on-the-mac-app-store.svg](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wallamac/id1621482657)

## Notice

I initially planned to distribute this app outside of the AppStore but it
turned out this isn't possible.
While you can distribute apps outside of the AppStore they cannot include
Safari Extensions.

After some thought I purchased a Apple Developer Account for 99â‚¬/year to
distribute the app.
I hope that some of you chime in and support me by tipping inside the app. When
the membership comes to an end I'll see how much tips got in and reconsider if
I want to continue to pay for the membership.
