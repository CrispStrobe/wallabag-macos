# Wallabag QuickSave

This is a macOS app which allows you to save links directly from Safari to a
Wallabag instance. I plan to add a Share Extension in the future as well.

You can download it in the AppStore:

[![Download On The AppStore](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-download-on-the-mac-app-store.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wallabag-quicksave/id1621482657)

## Installs and Tips (22.01.2023)

The app is now available for a bit over 11 months.
It got 227 installations with a majority (75) from the USA followed by Germany (38).
There were 4 tips with an overall amount of $12.
Three of those four tips were already paid which resulted in 5,82€.
I expect around 4€ for the last tip which isn't paid by Apple yet.
So the overall proceeds after Apples cut will be a little less than 10€ while I paid 99€ to have the App in the AppStore for this timeframe.

After all don't be surprised when the Wallabag Safari Extension will disappear after the 17th of February 2023.

## Notice

I initially planned to distribute this app outside of the AppStore but it
turned out this isn't possible.
While you can distribute apps outside of the AppStore they cannot include
Safari Extensions.

After some thought I purchased a Apple Developer Account for 99€/year to
distribute the app.
I hope that some of you chime in and support me by tipping inside the app. When
the membership comes to an end I'll see how much tips got in and reconsider if
I want to continue to pay for the membership.
